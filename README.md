# NIDS-based-on-FS-DL
The FS-DL method is a data-centric approach for the field of intrusion detection. This method uses a very small number of features to train the model and has achieved good results on both the NSL-KDD and WNSW-NB15 datasets.

The deep learning neural network model is implemented using the Python 3.8 and Keras 2.4 development frameworks.
